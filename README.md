# Backend con Node
## Proyecto de m√≥dulo: nodepop
#### Elisa Levy Gracia | 06/01/2023  

## Overview

This repository implements an ad API. This API provides developers a set of tools for accessing a collection of ads in various ways.

## Installation and setting up

### 1. Dependencies

First, be sure to have installed `Node.js` and the `npm` package manager. Then, navigate to the project root and run

```
npm install 
```

to install dependencies.

You will also need to have installed MongoDB as the local database for the project. Make sure that the server is running before continuing. (follow the official instructions for your system [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/#:~:text=of%20MongoDB%20instead.-,MongoDB%20Installation%20Tutorials,-MongoDB%20installation%20tutorials)). It should be running on the default port `27017`. 

### 2. Database ingestion

To ingest sample ads onto the database, just run

```
npm run init-db
```

This will create the `nodepopdb` database and an `ads` collection.

With everything set up, you should be able to start the app:

```
DEBUG=nodepop:* npm start 
```

and be able to access it in `localhost:3000`. Make sure that the port is not in use by other applications.

## Usage

### 1. Retrieving ads

- `GET/apiv1/ads`. Returns a JSON object will all ads in the collection.
- Filter options:
    - `tag=tagName`. (`tagName`: `string`) Filters by the specified `tagName`.
    - `venta=isSale`. (`isSale`: `bool`) Gets ads that are categorised for sale or as looking for.
    - `nombre=name`. (`name`: `string`) Gets ads whose field `nombre` starts with / matches `name`.
    - `precio=price`. (`price`: [`number`, `string`]) 
        - `price` is a number: returns ads whose field `precio` matches `price`.
        - `price` has the format `-n`, where `n` is a number: returns ads whose field `precio` is lower or equal than `n`. 
        - `price` has the format `n-`, where `n` is a number: returns ads whose field `precio` is greater than `n`.
        - `price` has the format `n-m`, where `n` and `m` are a number: returns ads whose field `precio` is between `n` and `m`, inclusive.
- Return options:
    - `sort=fieldName`. (`fieldName`: `string`). Sorts the ads ascending by the specified `fieldName`.
    - Paging fields:
        - `start=n` (`n`: `int`). Specifies the starting ad to be shown. That is, if a query returns 10 ads, `start=5` will make it so that only the last 5 ads are shown.
        - `limit=n` (`n`: `int`). Specifies the number of ads to be shown. That is, if a query returns 10 ads, `limit=5` will make it so that only the first 5 ads are shown.
        - A value of `0` (default) makes it so that all ads are shown (start is the beginning and there is no limit).
        - Both fields can work in conjuction to implement paging: given 10 adds `limit=5` will show the first 5 and `start=5&limit=5` will show the last 5.

Example **GET**

```
http://localhost:3000/apiv1/ads?tag=mobile&venta=false&nombre=ip&precio=50-&start=0&limit=2&sort=precio
```

### 2. Retrieving existing tags

- `GET /apiv1/tags`. Returns a list with all existing, unique tags.

Example

```
http://localhost:3000/apiv1/tags
```

### 3. Retrieving images

- `GET /images/$imageName`. Returns the specified ad image (`$imageName`). Ads with an image specify their associated image name in the `foto` field.

Example

```
http://localhost:3000/images/iphone.jpg
```

## Architecture

All functionality for version v1 of the ad retrieval API is implemented in `routes/apiv1.js`. Each route is separately defined, for each HTTP methods supported. 
Static resource retrieval is not considered a part of the ad query engine, and so it has been implemented in the main `app.js` file.
